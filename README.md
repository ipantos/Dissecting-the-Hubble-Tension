## 🆕 What's New in Version 2
*   **Expanded Dataset:** Now includes **88** Sound-Horizon-independent H₀ measurements (added 5 new recent measurements).
*   **Refined KDE Analysis:** Implementation of Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation with **optimized/reduced bandwidth** for a clearer visualization of the bimodality.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis:** New statistical tests regarding the categorization of measurements to ensure robustness against classification bias.

---

## 📊 Methodology & Key Innovations

*   **Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE):** Construction of PDFs with adaptive weighting.
*   **Bimodality Detection:** Specifically tuned KDE bandwidth to reveal hidden population splits in "One-Step" measurements.
*   **Categorization Sensitivity:** Analysis of how results change when measurements shift between categories (V2 feature).
